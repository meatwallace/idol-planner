# Path of Exile - Idol Planner

A web-based planner tool for Path of Exile's Idol system that helps players optimize their Idol grid layouts.

## Overview

The Idol system in Path of Exile allows players to socket special items called "Idols" into a grid-based interface. Each Idol provides specific bonuses to the character, and efficient placement of these Idols is crucial for maximizing character power.

## Core Features

### Grid System

- Fixed-size grid layout representing the Idol socket interface
- Support for blocked/unavailable grid squares
- Visual representation of the grid state
- Ability to view both empty and filled grid spaces

### Idol Mechanics

- Support for various Idol sizes. Example:
  - 1x1 (single square)
  - 2x2 (four squares)
  - 1x3 (three squares horizontally)
- Each Idol can have up to 4 modifiers:
  - Maximum of 2 prefix modifiers
  - Maximum of 2 suffix modifiers
  - Minimum of 1 modifier (can be either prefix or suffix)
- Idols cannot overlap with each other or blocked squares

### Idol Management

- Idol Configuration:
  - Configuration panel below the grid for creating new idols
  - Form to specify:
    - Idol size (1x1, 2x2, 1x3, etc.)
    - Label/name for the idol
    - Prefix and suffix modifiers
  - Preview of the idol being configured
  - Save idol to inventory
  - Edit existing idols
- Idol Inventory:
  - Sidebar panel displaying saved idols
  - List view with:
    - Idol name/label
    - Visual preview of size/shape
    - Quick view of modifiers
  - Actions:
    - Drag idol to grid for placement
    - Edit idol configuration
    - Delete idol from inventory
    - Duplicate existing idol

### Placement System

- Drag-and-Drop Interface:
  - Drag idols from inventory to grid
  - Visual preview of idol being placed
  - Visual feedback during dragging:
    - Show valid placement positions
    - Highlight invalid positions (blocked/occupied cells)
    - Preview of idol position while dragging
- Placement Rules:
  - Idols can only be placed on active grid cells
  - All cells required by the idol must be active
  - Cannot overlap with other idols or blocked cells
  - Must be fully contained within the grid
  - Visual indicator for valid/invalid placement during drag
- Grid Management:
  - Remove placed idols
  - Clear visual indication of placed idols
  - Hover state showing idol details

### User Interface Layout

- Main Grid Area:
  - Central placement of the idol grid
  - Clear visual hierarchy
- Idol Configuration (Bottom Panel):
  - Form for creating/editing idols
  - Size selection
  - Modifier configuration
  - Save/Update buttons
- Idol Inventory (Side Panel):
  - List of saved idols
  - Drag handles for placement
  - Quick actions (edit/delete)
  - Search/filter options

## Technical Requirements

- Review [.cursor/rules](.cursor/rules) for implementation guidelines

## Future Considerations

- Save/load functionality for different layouts
- Import/export of configurations
- Bonus calculation and optimization suggestions
- Integration with Path of Exile's API (if available)
- Support for different grid layouts/sizes
- Modifier database and filtering system
- Total modifier calculation across all placed Idols
